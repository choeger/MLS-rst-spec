Installation instruction
------------------------

On Windows:

Install Python 2.7.9+. Choose the option to add Python to the PATH.

Open cmd.exe and run the following commands:

>>> pip install --upgrade sphinx
>>> pip install --upgrade sphinxcontrib-inlinesyntaxhighlight
>>> cd /path/to/MLS-rst-spec
>>> make.bat html

You have built the documentation (with the exception of some LaTeX/math things that can be built by changing the configuration slightly).
