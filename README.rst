Installation instruction
------------------------

On Windows:

In order to make sure that things work as epxpected we don't use
a globally installed Python version but install a local one.
This does not require any adminstrator privileges.

Open cmd.exe and run the following commands:

>>> cd /path/to/MLS-rst-spec
>>> installSphinx.bat
>>> make.bat html

You have built the documentation (with the exception of some LaTeX/math things that can be built by changing the configuration slightly).
